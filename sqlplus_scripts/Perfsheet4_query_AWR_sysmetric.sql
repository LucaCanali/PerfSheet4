-- Perfsheet4_query_AWR_sysmetric.sql -> Extracts data from dba_hist_sysmetric_summary 
-- output is in csv format
-- Luca Canali, Oct 2012

-- Usage:
--   Run the script from sql*plus connected as a priviledged user (need to be able to read AWR tables)
--   Can run it over sql*net from client machine or locally on db server
--   Customize the file perfsheet4_definitions.sql before running this, in particular define there the interval of analysis
